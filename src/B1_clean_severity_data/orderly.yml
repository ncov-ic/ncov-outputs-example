# You must list at least one artefact that your report will generate.
# Each artefact consists of one or more files.  The format is to list
# the "type" of an artefact (staticgraph, interactivegraph, data,
# report), then below that a description (free text) and then a
# filename as either a single file or an array of files

#           description: A complex report

# An optional name to describe the report in more detail than its

# "description" (which can be as long as you want).  Must be a string.

# displayname:

# An optional free-text description to decsribe the report in as much
# detail as you want.  Must be a string.  The yaml `>-` or `|` syntax
# might be useful for long descriptions.

# Packages that should be loaded before the script is run.  Use this
# in preference to explicit library() calls in your script because it
# will make it easier to provision containers to run the orderly
# reports.
packages:
  - knitr
  - tidyr
  - dplyr
  - readr
  - janitor
  - lubridate
  - googlesheets4
  - magrittr
  - ggplot2
  - ggpubr

# Source files, in addition to the script.  Typically these will
# contain function definitions.  These will be sourced after loading
# any packages, and before running your script.  Use this in
# preference to explicit source() calls in your script because
# otherwise you will have to add them to "resources" (see below)
#
sources:
  - R/get_symptoms.R
#   - R/get_table_projections.R
#   - R/make_proj_plot.R
#   - R/get_R0_to_hit_threshold.R
#   - R/add_multiple_incid.R
#   - R/process_param.R
#   - R/plot_si.R
#   - R/get_total_incid.R

# Resources that the script needs to run; this is an array of strings
# representing filenames *relative to, and below, this directory*.
# These will be copied into place when the script is run, and again
# when commiting the report.  If you require a file and do not list it
# here, your script will fail!  (That's a good thing because we find
# out what your script actually needed immediately).  You do not need
# to list files already listed in "sources" here, or any .sql files
# referenced in "views" or "data"
